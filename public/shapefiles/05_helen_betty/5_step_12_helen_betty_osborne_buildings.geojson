It is currently managed by The Winnipeg Foundation.<br><br><h4> Naming Recognitions</h4>The University of Winnipeg named the building housing the Wii Chiiwaakanak Learning Centre and other Indigenous education initiatives the “Helen Betty Osborne Building.” This naming recognized Helen Betty and Indigenous women who have experienced violence, and acknowledged her as a symbol of hope for young Indigenous adults due to her commitment to education.<figure><img src='./images/05_helen_betty/5_HBO Building_b_cropped.jpg', class='popup-img'><figcaption>In 2018, Metis mural artist Kenneth Lavallee led a project to cover the Helen Betty Osborne building with a star blanket. In Indigenous traditions, being gifted with a star blanket is a high honour. It is intended to protect, honour, and recognize the work an individual does to forge a path to the future. The mural is dedicated to MMIWG2S+ (Niigaan Sinclair, 2018).</figcaption></figure>"
